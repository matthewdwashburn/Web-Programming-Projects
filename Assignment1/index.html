            <b>Overview</b>
        </p>
        James Morgan "Jimmy" McGill, better known by his alias Saul Goodman, is a fictional character created by
        Vince
        Gilligan and Peter Gould and portrayed by Bob Odenkirk in the television franchise Breaking Bad. He appears
        as a
        major character in Breaking Bad (2009–2013) and as the titular protagonist of its spin-off Better Call Saul
        (2015–2022).

        Saul is an unscrupulous Albuquerque-based lawyer and con artist who becomes involved in the city's criminal
        underworld. In Breaking Bad, he acts as the consigliere for the methamphetamine cooks Walter White and Jesse
        Pinkman
        and plays a crucial role in the development of their drug empire. Better Call Saul's main storyline depicts
        Saul's
        origins as the aspiring lawyer Jimmy McGill and his moral deterioration in the six years before the events
        of
        Breaking Bad; it also features a post-Breaking Bad storyline, where Saul is living under the assumed name
        Gene
        Takavic, that explores the consequences of his actions in the franchise.

        Saul first appeared in "Better Call Saul" (2009), the eighth episode of Breaking Bad's second season. He was
        created
        to provide Walt and Jesse with a guide for their criminal activities and to replace Hank Schrader as
        Breaking
        Bad's
        comic relief. His name, "Saul Goodman", is a play on the phrase "it's all good, man". Although Odenkirk was
        initially cast for only four episodes as a guest actor, he became integral to the Breaking Bad narrative
        after
        Gilligan and Gould were impressed by his performance; Odenkirk subsequently joined the main cast in the
        third
        season
        and remained through to the fifth and final season of the show. Following Breaking Bad's conclusion,
        Gilligan
        and
        Gould began developing a Saul-focused spin-off depicting his origin story. The character also appeared in
        the
        animated short-form series Slippin' Jimmy (2022), a spin-off of Better Call Saul which follows his childhood
        misadventures.

        Saul's characterization and Odenkirk's performance received critical acclaim. Odenkirk was nominated for the
        Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series six times for his performance in Better
        Call
        Saul
        tying the record for most nominations without a win in the category.

            <b>Development</b>
        </p>
        Bob Odenkirk portrays Saul Goodman / Jimmy McGill in both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul
        The need for a character like Saul came from two paths of Breaking Bad's development around the second
        season.
        First, as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman got themselves deeper into the drug business, the writers felt they
        needed
        a character to be a guide for them. At this point, they had written that Jesse's dimwitted friends like
        Badger
        were
        selling their drugs, and needed to envision what type of lawyer Walt and Jesse would enlist when they run
        into
        trouble. This would later serve to introduce Walter to new concepts such as the Disappearer's services.
        Secondly, they were at a point in Hank Schrader's character arc where he had suffered major trauma in seeing
        Tortuga's severed head, and he would no longer be able to serve as the series' bit of lightness. They thus
        made
        Saul
        more of a comical character to fill this void. The writers wrote this lawyer as loud, flashy, and
        over-the-top,
        as well as being as much of a criminal as the people. The creators decided on the name "Saul Goodman" as a
        play
        on the phrase "'s all good, man", so that even his most simple-minded clients would remember his name when
        they
        get arrested. Gould credits Breaking Bad's creator Vince Gilligan for initially suggesting this idea for
        Saul's
        name.

        The Breaking Bad episode "Better Call Saul" was written by Peter Gould, and he has been ultimately credited
        with
        creating the character. In terms of casting for the part, both Gilligan and Gould said that their crew
        included
        a
        number of fans of Mr. Show with Bob and David, including Gould's wife Nora, and Odenkirk's name quickly came
        up
        for
        the role. Gilligan offered Odenkirk a four-episode guest role without the need to audition. Odenkirk at the
        time had been focused on mentoring upcoming actors in comedy, and, needing an opportunity, readily took the
        role
        at
        the encouragement of his friend Reid Harrison, having not seen any of Breaking Bad and thinking that it was
        only
        intended for a short stint. Odenkirk watched available episodes of Breaking Bad before arriving for shooting
        and
        avoided reading the script he had been sent knowing that it would likely be trimmed down before filming.
        Odenkirk
        based the character's speaking style on producer Robert Evans, and spent time practicing speaking in Evans'
        style
        based on the autobiography The Kid Stays in the Picture. Bryan Cranston helped Odenkirk to learn more about
        what
        Breaking Bad was about and to coach him on dramatic acting, something which Odenkirk lacked from his comedy
        background. Odenkirk was scheduled to appear in the second-season finale, but a prior commitment on How I
        Met
        Your Mother left him unable to do so; this led Gilligan to create the character of Mike Ehrmantraut, played
        by
        Jonathan Banks, to serve in place of Saul for that fourth episode.

        Saul was originally intended to appear in only four episodes of the second season of Breaking Bad, but
        instead
        became central to the narrative of the series. Though originally written as a "two-and-a-half-dimensional"
        comic
        relief character, Saul's role became more in-depth, as Gilligan and Gould found they could use Saul as a
        "further
        entree to the criminal underbelly" for Walt in the later seasons. This also allowed them to give the
        character
        more humanity, which the showrunners credited to Odenkirk's acting skills. They considered that like with
        Aaron
        Paul
        and Dean Norris, Odenkirk's acting capability significantly altered plans they had for these characters and
        the
        series in a beneficial manner, making them more central to the larger plot. As Saul had proven to be a
        popular
        character with audiences, Gilligan and Gould already had started thinking about a spin-off involving Saul
        and
        approached Odenkirk on his interest to make it happen. Odenkirk had initially turned down the continuing
        role,
        wanting to be with his family in Los Angeles and feeling he had enough fame with the success of Breaking
        Bad,
        but
        his children assured them that they would be fine and he should not turn the opportunity down.

        Once Breaking Bad was completed, Gilligan and Gould worked to establish what the spinoff series would be
        about,
        ultimately coming onto the idea of a prequel named Better Call Saul that would feature Jimmy McGill and how
        he
        would
        become Saul Goodman. The showrunners realized that Saul was, as seen in Breaking Bad, "comfortable in his
        own
        skin"
        and had nowhere else to go, that they could instead explore how Saul got to that point, mirroring the same
        type
        of
        self-destruction that occurred to Walter White in Breaking Bad. They saw Jimmy as an "earnest, sweet guy
        whose
        brain naturally cooks up dishonest solutions to the challenges in front of him", where by the time of
        Breaking
        Bad,
        Saul is a "front" for one who "seemed to enjoy being a showy cheeseball", and a "hermetically sealed
        slickster". Rhea Seehorn, who plays Kim Wexler, Jimmy's romantic interest in Better Call Saul, said that one
        aspect of Jimmy she incorporated into her acting was the spontaneity of Jimmy slipping into and out of the
        Saul
        Goodman character, or as Gould had described to her, "right there at the moment", a factor that for Kim and
        other
        associates of Jimmy can cause confusion and concern.

        Breaking Bad established little of Saul's origins, but revealed that Saul Goodman was not his real name and
        that
        his
        real last name was McGill. This gave Gilligan, Gould, and Odenkirk a chance to flesh out more of Jimmy's
        backstory for Better Call Saul. Odenkirk and Gilligan set Jimmy's hometown as Chicagoland (specifically
        Cicero),
        in
        part as Odenkirk was from nearby Berwyn, as well as a homage to the notorious corruption in the political
        history of
        Chicago as inspiration for the character.

        In 2014, as a publicity stunt for the launch of Better Call Saul, a billboard for "James M. McGill, Attorney
        at
        Law"
        was placed in Albuquerque, mimicking a billboard that appeared on the series, with a phone number connecting
        to
        a
        voicemail message recorded by Odenkirk.

        In conceiving the story for El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, which continues Jesse Pinkman's story after the
        events
        of the Breaking Bad series finale, Gilligan considered including Saul, feeling that using him in the story
        would
        have been great. However, Gilligan eventually desisted from including him due to being unaware of the
        potential
        plans Gould and the Better Call Saul writers could have for the character in his show, as Gilligan left the
        writers'
        room of the show after the third season.

            <b>Biography</b>
        </p>
        Jimmy is of Irish descent and was born on November 12, 1960, to Charles Willard McGill and Ruth McGill, in
        Cicero,
        Illinois, near Chicago. His older brother Chuck became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at
        Albuquerque law firm Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). As a child, Jimmy worked at his parents' corner store in
        Cicero,
        and watched as customers took advantage of his gullible, naive father; Jimmy soon began pilfering small
        change
        from
        the store.

        Determined not to end up like his father, Jimmy became a con artist and earned the nickname "Slippin' Jimmy"
        for
        staging "slip and fall" accidents. He also ran petty scams including the "fake Rolex" with the help of his
        high
        school friend and partner-in-crime Marco Pasternak. Jimmy began to use the alias "Saul Goodman", a play on
        the
        phrase "It's all good, man". He initially used it as a fake name when performing his scams with Marco.
        Later, he
        used the alternative identity for the high-energy pitchman in television ads he produced, and made use of it
        when he began a business reselling prepaid cell phones on the street.

        At some point prior to the start of Better Call Saul, Jimmy had been married and divorced twice. One of his
        ex-wives cheated on him with a man named Chet. Jimmy ran into trouble when he drunkenly defecated through
        the
        sunroof of Chet's car, an act he calls a "Chicago Sunroof". Unbeknown to Jimmy, Chet's children were inside
        the
        vehicle. Arrested and facing the possibility of having to register as a sex offender, and in spite of a
        five-year
        separation from his family, Jimmy turned to Chuck for help. Chuck successfully defended Jimmy, but required
        that
        Jimmy move to Albuquerque and work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room.

        While working in the HHM mail room, Jimmy befriended Kim Wexler, an HHM employee attending the University of
        New
        Mexico School of Law. Over time, their friendship turned romantic. Inspired by her success and Chuck's
        career,
        Jimmy
        resumed his education, completing his undergraduate degree and then a J.D. from the (fictional) University
        of
        American Samoa's correspondence law school. He passed the bar exam hoping to be hired at HHM, but Chuck
        secretly
        compelled senior partner Howard Hamlin to deny Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then began a solo practice as a
        lawyer, basing his office in the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon at a strip mall. During this
        period, he
        took whatever cases he could get, including low-paying public defender work.

        Some years later, near the time of Chuck's divorce with Rebecca, Chuck developed a psychosomatic aversion to
        electricity and became semi-reclusive. Jimmy cared for Chuck, bringing him groceries and running his
        errands.
        However, Jimmy still struggled with finances, and at the start of the show drove a signature Suzuki Esteem
        with
        mismatched doors, a visual pun reflecting Jimmy's poor self-esteem. While arriving at and departing from
        court,
        Jimmy frequently butted heads with Mike Ehrmantraut, a former Philadelphia police officer who at that time
        worked as
        the courthouse parking lot attendant.
